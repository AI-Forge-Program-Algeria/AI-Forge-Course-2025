    "## Why Not Always Use Multi-Layered Model?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that multi-layered model is more *powerful* and *expressive*, than one-layered one. You may be wondering why don't we always use many-layered model. The answer to this question is **overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will deal with this term more in a later sections, but the idea is the following: **the more powerful the model is, the better it can approximate training data, and the more data it needs to properly generalize** for the new data it has not seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A linear model:**\n",
    "* We are likely to get high training loss - so-called **underfitting**, when the model does not have enough power to correctly separate all data. \n",
    "* Valiadation loss and training loss are more or less the same. The model is likely to generalize well to test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complex multi-layered model**\n",
    "* Low training loss - the model can approximate training data well, because it has enough expressive power.\n",
    "* Validation loss can be much higher than training loss and can start to increase during training - this is because the model \"memorizes\" training points, and loses the \"overall picture\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Overfitting](images/overfit.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "> On this picture, `x` stands for training data, `o` - validation data. Left - linear model (one-layer), it approximates the nature of the data pretty well. Right - overfitted model, the model perfectly well approximates training data, but stops making sense with any other data (validation error is very high)"

    "* Simple models (fewer layers, fewer neurons) with low number of parameters (\"low capacity\") are less likely to overfit\n",

    "* You can solve overfitting problem by either:\n",
    "    - simplifying your model\n",
    "    - increasing the amount of training data\n",
    "* **Bias-variance trade-off** is a term that shows that you need to get the compromise\n",

    "    - between overfittig and underfitting\n",
